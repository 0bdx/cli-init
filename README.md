When installed as a global package, `@0bdx/cli-init` is available as:  
`0bdx-upgrade`

For a more user friendly CLI experience, try installing `@0bdx/cli` globally.  
`@0bdx/cli` actually installs `@0bdx/cli-init` as a local dependency, and
invokes it when you’ve completed the ‘Initialise’ wizard.
